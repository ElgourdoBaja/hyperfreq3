The AI engineer's work pivoted from a Hypertrader 1.5 Windows deployment (which encountered JavaScript syntax errors in the installer) to a new, distinct project: installing and configuring Freqtrade for Hyperliquid on a Linux Mint machine. The initial phase of this new project focused heavily on environment setup, particularly resolving Python versioning conflicts (shifting from a requested Python 3.12 to 3.11 per user instruction) and managing numerous Python package dependencies, including persistent challenges with TA-Lib that were temporarily bypassed. A significant milestone achieved is the confirmation of native Hyperliquid exchange support within Freqtrade 2024.11. The current immediate task involves extracting necessary Hyperliquid API credentials from the previously developed Hypertrader-1.5 repository, which has been cloned for this purpose, with wallet addresses already identified and the search for API keys/secrets ongoing.

<product_requirements>
The user's current core requirement is to install and configure Freqtrade for Hyperliquid perpetual exchange on a Linux Mint machine. The setup must:
- Be configured to trade the 50 highest-volume pairs on Hyperliquid.
- Utilize Hyperliquid API credentials (Metamask wallet address, API address, API secret key) copied from the  repository.
- Have its project code pushed to  for backup.
- Use Python 3.11 (initially 3.12, but changed by user).
- Be easily switchable between Hyperliquid testnet and mainnet.
- Support order placement for both long and short positions with stop loss and take profit.
- Fetch market data candles at the shortest feasible timeframe for Hyperliquid.
- Monitor market data for the 50 most active cryptocurrencies on Hyperliquid for trading by the active strategy.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Freqtrade**: An open-source cryptocurrency algorithmic trading bot.
-   **Hyperliquid API**: The interface for interacting with the Hyperliquid perpetual decentralized exchange.
-   **Python 3.11**: The specified programming language environment for Freqtrade.
-   **Docker**: Containerization technology (for future deployment).
-   **Git**: Version control for codebase management.
-   **CCXT**: Cryptocurrency Exchange Trading Library (used by Freqtrade for exchange integration).

<code_architecture>
The application's current focus has shifted entirely to the Freqtrade project setup, though it leverages a cloned repository from the previous project for credential extraction.



-   ****: This directory contains the entire Freqtrade repository, specifically checked out to version . It is the primary location where the Freqtrade bot will be configured, strategies will be added, and trading operations will be managed. Its importance lies in being the core of the new trading automation project.
-   ****: This specific file within the Freqtrade source code confirms Freqtrade's native and direct support for the Hyperliquid exchange. Its presence is critical as it simplifies the integration, allowing Freqtrade to interact with Hyperliquid without extensive custom exchange adapter development.
-   ****: This is a temporary clone of the previous  project's GitHub repository (). Its sole purpose in the current context is to serve as a source for extracting the previously configured Hyperliquid API credentials (wallet address, API key, and API secret). The agent is currently traversing this repository to locate these sensitive values, specifically looking in  files or similar configuration points within its  and  directories.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Extract Hyperliquid API address, secret key, and Metamask wallet address from .
-   Configure Freqtrade with extracted credentials for Hyperliquid exchange.
-   Set up Freqtrade to monitor and trade the 50 highest-volume pairs on Hyperliquid.
-   Implement easy switching between Hyperliquid testnet and mainnet within Freqtrade configuration.
-   Develop a sample strategy supporting long/short positions with stop loss and take profit.
-   Ensure proper Docker container functionality for the Freqtrade setup.
-   Push the completed Freqtrade project to .

<current_work>
The project has shifted from Hypertrader 1.5 to setting up Freqtrade for Hyperliquid on a Linux Mint machine. The AI engineer has made significant progress in preparing the environment and base installation:
1.  **Freqtrade Installation**: Freqtrade version  has been successfully cloned and the base installation procedures have been run.
2.  **Python Versioning**: Initially tasked with Python 3.12, the user redirected to use Python 3.11.13, which is now the active Python version for the Freqtrade environment.
3.  **Dependency Resolution**: Numerous Python dependency issues were encountered during  (e.g., , , , ), but these were systematically resolved.
4.  **TA-Lib Bypass**: A recurring issue with TA-Lib installation (a common Freqtrade dependency) led to a strategic decision to temporarily bypass its full installation, focusing on core Freqtrade functionality and Hyperliquid connectivity first.
5.  **Hyperliquid Support Confirmation**: It has been confirmed that Freqtrade 2024.11 natively supports the Hyperliquid exchange, as evidenced by the presence and examination of .
The immediate and ongoing task is to extract the necessary Hyperliquid API credentials (Metamask wallet address, API address, API secret key) from the previously developed  repository, which has been cloned to . The agent has successfully located potential wallet addresses (e.g., , ) and is currently searching for the corresponding API key and secret values within that cloned repository.
