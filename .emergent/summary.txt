The AI engineer's journey involved a significant pivot from a Windows Hypertrader deployment to setting up and configuring Freqtrade for Hyperliquid on a Linux Mint environment. Initially, the focus was on extracting API credentials from a cloned Hypertrader-1.5 repository, which proved futile as only empty placeholders were found. This led to a direct request for user-provided credentials.

A major challenge arose from a core misunderstanding regarding the installation location: the user explicitly requested installation on their *local Linux Mint machine*, while the AI engineer initially performed installations within the *containerized environment*. This led to repeated clarifications and a shift towards providing explicit command-line instructions for the user's local machine.

The most critical technical hurdle was the Hyperliquid exchange integration within Freqtrade. Despite initial confirmation of native support, it became apparent that Freqtrade's default CCXT integration for Hyperliquid failed to fetch real-time OHLCV data, leading to stale prices and rendering trading signals inaccurate. The AI engineer diagnosed this by comparing Freqtrade's prices with actual market data. The breakthrough involved leveraging knowledge from the previous Hypertrader-1.5 project, which successfully used direct Hyperliquid API calls for real-time data. This required deep modification of Freqtrade's installed  file, resolving issues like duplicate class definitions, incorrect method signatures (, ), and ensuring Python module caching didn't prevent fixes from loading.

Finally, efforts to enable the Freqtrade web UI encountered FastAPI/Pydantic compatibility problems, which were addressed by fixing parameter definitions in . The trajectory concludes with the web UI installation nearing completion, confirming the mainnet dry run with accurate real-time data and functional trading signals.

<code_architecture>
The application's architecture evolved significantly, from a temporary setup leveraging cloned repositories for credential extraction to a dedicated Freqtrade installation within the container, which is being prepared for transfer to the user's local machine.



-   ****: This file from the old project was crucial for understanding how to correctly interact with the Hyperliquid API for real-time data, as it did not rely on historical OHLCV data. This understanding directly informed the fix for Freqtrade's Hyperliquid integration.
-   ****: This configuration file, created by the AI engineer, defines the Freqtrade settings for the Hyperliquid testnet. It contains API credentials, trading parameters (stake amount, stop loss, take profit, leverage), pairlist methods (VolumePairList, etc.), and exchange-specific options.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial creation with user's provided API credentials. Modified to set  for safe testing. Later,  were reconfigured (temporarily static, then back to dynamic) and  was enabled for the web UI. Most critically,  was set to 0.
-   ****: Similar to the testnet config, but configured for the Hyperliquid mainnet (e.g., ).
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial creation mirroring testnet config, with the  option set to  for mainnet connectivity.
-   ****: The initial trading strategy implemented based on the user's requirements (MA crossover, SL, TP, leverage).
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial creation, reflecting the specified trading logic and parameters.
-   ****: A simplified strategy created to work with minimal historical data, focusing on real-time price action after discovering Hyperliquid's data limitations.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to adapt to the real-time data streaming nature of Hyperliquid, bypassing reliance on extensive historical OHLCV data.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully installed and configured Freqtrade (version 2025.6) for Hyperliquid trading within the containerized environment. This includes setting up the Python 3.11 environment, configuring both testnet and mainnet, and implementing the  with the user's specified parameters.

A critical issue with the Hyperliquid integration was identified: Freqtrade's default CCXT integration was fetching stale price data, leading to a significant discrepancy with actual market prices. This was resolved by meticulously modifying the *installed*  file. The fix involved:
1.  Leveraging the real-time API call approach observed in the  project.
2.  Eliminating a duplicate  class definition within the installed file that was overriding the intended fixes.
3.  Correcting  and  method signatures to align with Freqtrade's  base class, resolving  issues.
4.  Clearing Python module caches and restarting the environment to ensure the fixed class loaded correctly.

As a result, the Hyperliquid integration now fetches accurate, real-time mainnet prices, and the trading strategy is generating signals based on this correct data. The bot is currently running in **mainnet dry run mode**, safely simulating trades with real market conditions without placing actual orders.

The immediate work being carried out is enabling and fixing the Freqtrade web UI. Compatibility issues with FastAPI and Pydantic versions within the container were encountered and addressed by fixing parameter definitions in . The AI engineer is in the process of completing the web UI installation by downloading its frontend files ().
